              <p>We use Virginia Department of Education data on the Commonwealth's <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/student-assessment/virginia-sol-assessment-program">Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments</a> to visually illuminate the significant gaps in reading and math pass rates -- between Black students as compared to their White peers, between economically disadvantaged students as compared to their more fortunate classmates, and between Hispanic students as compared to their non-Hispanic peers. Research shows that lack of reading and math proficiency have long-lasting impacts on future educational attainment, future earnings, and more.  We seek to make this data easier to use for explorative purposes, as a call to action, and hopefully, as a manner by which localities can track progress in eliminating these gaps, and working towards the goal of reading and math proficiency for ALL students.
